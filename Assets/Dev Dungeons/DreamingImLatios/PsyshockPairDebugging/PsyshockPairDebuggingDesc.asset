  description: 'This dungeon is intended to be experimented with to help capture
    scenarios that produce incorrect Psyshock results and replay them for debugging.


    When
    drawing Distance Between operations, the drawer draws hatches at the closest
    points and unit normal vectors from the closest points. Red is for collider A,
    while blue is for collider B.


    When drawing Contact operations, the drawer
    draws lines between the contact points on each collider''s surface. The lines
    should all be parallel for each subcollider pair. Each subcollider pair is drawn
    with a different hue. Darker variants of the same hue specify the contact points
    are penetrating.


    If any result does not look right, capture the hex string
    from the Playbacker inspector and share it over Discord!'
